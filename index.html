        <p><strong>Hello I’m Gaby.</strong></p>
        <p>
            Based in Jakarta, I am a hardworking and detail-oriented individual with a strong passion for creativity. I am eager to contribute my skills to a growth-oriented environment where I can continue to learn and take on a new challenge. Many have described me as self driven and always ready to take on a challenge. My design philosophy is rooted in boldness. Designs often becomes muted and forgotten — but in a world overflowing with words, bold design grabs attention and cuts through the noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy taking pictures with my digi-cam and exploring new cuisines.

            I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the scenery in the UK.

          <h3>Toji Fushiguro × Under Armour — Concept Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            I started this project with the idea of creating a series of character collaborations with brands that would naturally align with the character. The concept features Toji Fushiguro from <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>
            paired with Under Armour.
          </p>

          <p>
            Toji’s intense physical ability and performance-driven personality made him an ideal choice to showcase Under Armour’s compression gear.
          </p>

          <p>
            This concept emphasizes on strength, motion, and high-performance wear.

          <h3>Tsukishima Kei × ASICS — Concept Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            This concept features Tsukishima Kei from the series <em>Haikyuu!!</em> partnered with Asics, a global leader in volleyball footwear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Asics appears frequently appears in the series under the fictional brand ‘ICS’, a play on the brands name. This reference reflects how the brand has influenced the volleyball industry, which only feels natural to create a collaboration between Haikyuu!! and Asics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tsukishima was chosen as the featured character due to his strategic approach to volleyball and his well known blocking ability in the series.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal of this concept was to highlight Asic’s core brand values - discipline and precision, which mirrors their ethos: “ Sound Mind, Sound Body ”.

          <h3>First-Person Shooter Level Design — University Project</h3>
      
          <p>
            This project focuses on level design for a first-person shooter prototype developed in Unreal Engine.
            The level was built through an iterative workflow, starting with a blockout mock-up to test scale,
            player flow, sightlines, and pacing before moving into a more refined layout.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Gameplay testing informed multiple revisions to improve navigation clarity, combat encounters,
            and overall player experience.
